description: "Construction and change detection from satellite and aerial imagery"
---

## Overview

**GeoPulse** monitors construction activity, parking lot changes, building footprint updates, and site development using weekly satellite/aerial imagery analysis.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `construction_delta` | % change in construction area |
| `building_footprint_change` | New/demolished structures |
| `parking_lot_expansion` | Added parking spaces |
| `trailer_count` | Construction trailers detected |

## Use Cases

- **Competitor Openings:** Detect pad/lot prep 90-180 days before opening
- **Store Closures:** Identify demolished or abandoned locations
- **Parking Expansion:** Track lot expansions for capacity planning
