## Vision

The Evoteli fuses **computer vision** (vehicle counting, drive-thru/curbside monitoring), **aerial/satellite change detection**, **geospatial data** (Maps, Earth, Places, Earth Engine), and **LLM copilots** to deliver **decision-grade signals** for commercial, residential, civic, and infrastructure use cases.

**Core Value:** Near-real-time competitor and site traffic intelligence, parcel-level property condition analysis, and actionable insights for planning, operations, marketing, and compliance—all with provenance, confidence scoring, and privacy-by-design.
