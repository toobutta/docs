## Overview

**DrivewayPro** (part of [HomeScope](/products/homescope)) segments and classifies driveways from aerial imagery, measuring area, material type, and condition for paving contractors and property assessments.

## Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `driveway_area` | Total driveway area (sq ft) |
| `driveway_material` | asphalt, concrete, gravel, paver |
| `driveway_condition` | 0-1 score (crack/wear detection) |
| `crack_density` | Cracks per 100 sq ft |

## Use Cases

- **Paving Contractor Leads:** Target `driveway_condition < 0.5` and `driveway_area > 400 sq ft`
- **Property Tax Assessments:** Accurate driveway area for impervious surface calculations
- **Seal Coating Campaigns:** Identify asphalt driveways needing maintenance

See [HomeScope documentation](/products/homescope) for full details.
