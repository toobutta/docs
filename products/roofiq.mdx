## Overview

**RoofIQ** is a core component of [HomeScope](/products/homescope) that analyzes roof geometry, condition, material, and age from aerial/satellite imagery.

## Metrics

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `roof_area` | Total roof surface area | sq ft |
| `roof_slope` | Average pitch | degrees |
| `roof_condition` | Condition score | 0-1 |
| `roof_age_band` | Estimated age bracket | 5-10, 10-15, 15+ years |
| `roof_material` | Material type | asphalt, metal, tile, etc. |
| `south_facing_area` | South-facing roof area (solar) | sq ft |

## Use Cases

- **Roof Replacement Leads:** Target homes with `roof_condition < 0.6` and `roof_age_band >= 15 years`
- **Insurance Underwriting:** Prefill roof attributes for quote acceleration
- **Solar Pre-Qualification:** Identify `south_facing_area > 300 sq ft` for solar campaigns

See [HomeScope documentation](/products/homescope) for full details and API examples.
