## Overview

**LotWatch** provides real-time vehicle detection and tracking for parking lots, drive-thru lanes, and curbside pickup zones. Monitor occupancy, queue lengths, service times, and traffic patterns to optimize operations and staffing.

## Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Occupancy">
    Current number of vehicles in the monitored zone
    - **Unit:** count
    - **Cadence:** 5-60 seconds
    - **Method:** edge_cv
  </Card>
  <Card title="Queue Length">
    Number of vehicles waiting in drive-thru or pickup lane
    - **Unit:** count
    - **Cadence:** 5-60 seconds
    - **Method:** edge_cv
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dwell Time (Median)">
    Median time vehicles spend in the zone
    - **Unit:** seconds
    - **Cadence:** 15-minute rollup
    - **Method:** edge_cv
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turnover Rate">
    Vehicles entering/exiting per hour
    - **Unit:** vehicles/hour
    - **Cadence:** 1-hour rollup
    - **Method:** edge_cv
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Time (p50/p95)">
    Percentile service times at drive-thru window
    - **Unit:** seconds
    - **Cadence:** 15-minute rollup
    - **Method:** edge_cv
  </Card>
  <Card title="Peak Hour Detection">
    Identifies consistent traffic patterns
    - **Unit:** timestamp
    - **Cadence:** daily
    - **Method:** fused
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Use Cases

### 1. Drive-Thru Queue Management

Monitor queue length in real-time and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

**Alert Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "queue_len_breach",
  "site_id": "ATL-CTF-001",
  "queue_len": 9,
  "duration_min": 12,
  "threshold": 7,
  "recommendation": "Add 2 staff; trigger 2-4pm 10% drink promo",
  "quality_score": 0.79
}
```

**ROI Impact:**
- Reduce average wait time by 10-20%
- Increase throughput during peak hours by 8-15%
- Prevent customer abandonment (estimated 5-10% at queue_len > 8)

### 2. Competitor Benchmarking

Compare your location's occupancy and service times against nearby competitors.

**Lunch Index (11:00-14:00):**
```
Brand A Median Occupancy: 18 vehicles
Brand B Median Occupancy: 24 vehicles
Competitor Index: 1.33 (Brand B attracting 33% more traffic)
```

**Action:** Trigger alert when index > 1.3 for 2+ consecutive weeks.

### 3. Parking Lot Utilization

Track parking occupancy to determine optimal lot sizing and overflow handling.

**Metrics:**
- Average occupancy by day-of-week and hour
- Peak occupancy events (>90% capacity)
- Turnover rate (ideal: 8-12 vehicles/hour for QSR)

## Technical Implementation

### Edge Device Setup

**Hardware Options:**
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano:** 1-2 cameras, 15-20 FPS
- **NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin:** 4-8 cameras, 20-30 FPS
- **Google Coral Dev Board:** 1 camera, 10-15 FPS (lower cost)

**Model:**
- YOLO11n or YOLOv8n (vehicle detection)
- ByteTrack (multi-object tracking)

**Privacy:**
- On-device face/plate blur before transmission
- No raw video stored or transmitted

[See edge deployment guide →](/deployment/edge-devices)

### Camera Placement

**Drive-Thru Lane:**
- **Overhead view:** Covers ordering station to pickup window
- **Field of view:** 20-30 meters
- **Height:** 4-6 meters

**Parking Lot:**
- **Elevated view:** Overlooks 30-50 parking spaces
- **Multiple cameras:** For lots >100 spaces
- **Coverage:** Aim for 80%+ lot visibility

### Data Flow

```
Camera (RTSP) → Edge Device (YOLO + Redaction)
  → MQTT Publish → Kafka → Beam Processing
  → ClickHouse → Signal API
```

**Latency:**
- Frame to detection: <200ms
- Detection to MQTT: <1s
- End-to-end to API: <10s

## API Query Example
