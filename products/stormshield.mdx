description: "Post-storm damage triage and contractor routing"
---

## Overview

**StormShield** (part of [HomeScope](/products/homescope)) provides rapid post-storm damage assessment by comparing pre-storm baseline imagery with post-event satellite/aerial data. Prioritizes parcels for adjuster and contractor dispatch.

## Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `storm_impact_score` | 0-1 damage likelihood |
| `roof_condition_delta` | Change in roof condition |
| `debris_detected` | Boolean (debris presence) |
| `triage_priority` | 1-5 urgency (1=urgent) |

## Workflow

1. **Pre-Storm Baseline:** Continuous monitoring establishes `roof_condition` baseline
2. **Storm Event:** NOAA/NWS footprint triggers analysis
3. **Post-Storm Imagery:** Acquire satellite imagery 24-48 hours after event
4. **Change Detection:** Compute `roof_condition_delta` and `debris_detected`
5. **Triage Export:** Generate prioritized parcel list for dispatch

## Example Output

```json
{
  "event_id": "NOAA-TX-2025-11-05",
  "affected_parcels": 1247,
  "high_priority_count": 89,
  "top_priority": [
    {
      "parcel_id": "TX-441-12345",
      "triage_priority": 1,
      "storm_impact_score": 0.87,
      "roof_condition_delta": -0.34,
      "debris_detected": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pricing

- **Per-Event:** $2,000 - $10,000 (covers 5k-20k parcels)
- **Subscription:** $500/month (up to 2 events/month)

See [HomeScope documentation](/products/homescope) for integration details.
